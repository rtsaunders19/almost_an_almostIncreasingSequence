Given an array of numbers, for each number find how many numbers after it, it is greater than. Then replace the number in the original array with that number. For example in the array [1,2,1], the value of the first index, 1, is not greater than the two numbers following it and will therefore be replaced by the number 0. 2 is greater than 1, so it will be replaced by the number 1, and 1 has no numbers following it so it will be replaced by the number 0. This would make the array [0,1,0].
